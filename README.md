For this segment, I created a blue background and a shocked emoji. I had never done coding before (other than year 9 computing), so this was very different and it was quite a unique experience, hence the shocked emoji. It was me capturing my emotions regarding my first time coding. This was an illustration of me testing out the various functions and beginning to learn/understand the basics to coding. One thing that stuck out to me the most was learning how each function works, although, this was also a challenge I faced. In order to create the final product, I did some research on how to create emojis, these were two of the videos that helped me understand what to do and what I got inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICr20WwO5w and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlQ_OY2jkfs
