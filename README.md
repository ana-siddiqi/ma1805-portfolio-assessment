[01.Drawing](01.drawing/index.html)

For this segment, I created a blue background and a shocked emoji. I had never done coding before (other than year 9 computing), so this was very different and it was quite a unique experience, hence the shocked emoji. It was me capturing my emotions regarding my first time coding. This was an illustration of me testing out the various functions and beginning to learn/understand the basics to coding. One thing that stuck out to me the most was learning how each function works, although, this was also a challenge I faced. In order to create the final product, I did some research on how to create emojis, these were two of the videos that helped me understand what to do and what I got inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICr20WwO5w and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlQ_OY2jkfs 

[02.Movement](02.movement/index.html)

What I did for this part of my project was creating a blue sky background with a yellow circle (resembling the sun) that is repeatedly moving towards the right, and with a click the circle spawns back to the left side of the screen. This is a metaphor of the internet (the sun being the net), the background is the soft appearance of the internet. Additionally, the repetitive movement of the yellow circle is a symbol that the internet is constantly running and even with a simple click, it doesn't stop, it keeps showing more and more information. For this part, I was inspired by the Coding Train and this is the video I used for reference, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T26OJGjI8qI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=10
