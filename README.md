For this segment, I created a blue background and a shocked emoji. I had never done coding before (other than year 9 computing), so this was very different and it was quite a unique experience, hence the shocked emoji. It was me capturing my emotions regarding my first time coding. This was an illustration of me testing out the various functions and beginning to learn/understand the basics to coding. One thing that stuck out to me the most was learning how each function works, although, this was also a challenge I faced. In order to create the final product, I did some research on how to create emojis, these were two of the videos that helped me understand what to do and what I got inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICr20WwO5w and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlQ_OY2jkfs 

[02.Movement](02.movement/index.html)

What I did for this part of my project was creating a blue sky background with a yellow circle (resembling the sun) that is repeatedly moving towards the right, and with a click the circle spawns back to the left side of the screen. This is a metaphor of the internet (the sun being the net), the background is the soft appearance of the internet. Additionally, the repetitive movement of the yellow circle is a symbol that the internet is constantly running and even with a simple click, it doesn't stop, it keeps showing more and more information. For this part, I was inspired by the Coding Train and this is the video I used for reference, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T26OJGjI8qI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&index=10  



[03.Multiples](03.multiples/index.html)

For this mini project I created overlapping circles that follow the mouse around the screen and with a simple click of the mouse, the colour of the circles change colour. This was quite challenging because this was only my second time using the mouse function but once I got it to work, it became easier. Furthermore, this project was also a metaphor for media, the different circles connoting to various kinds of media. This illustrates that no matter what form of media you are accessing, media is constant and always running. 


[04.Media](04.media/index.html)

Lastly, for this mini project, I created a page including an image of the moon (that I shot on my cousin's telescope), and a video of the ocean and moon at night (that I recorded on holiday). Incorporating my own media made this project more personal. Additionally, I included a text that says "The moonlight ripples across the water the way information ripples through the internet" which is an explicit metaphor for how complex the internet is and how it is gaining/giving new information every second. There were a few challenges I faced during this segment, for instance, I couldn't get my code to work but then I realised I typed in the image, video and audio URL incorrectly. I noticed the issue when I opened a live server and it was blank, once I had fixed the issue it began to work. Another issue I had was the video wasn't showing up until I typed in "video.play();". Moreover, I wanted ocean sounds so I downloaded an audio from a free downloads website https://pixabay.com/sound effects/search/ocean/ and I utilised that in a unique way. With the click of the mouse, the looped audio of the rushing waves in the ocean plays, signifying the constant rush and chaos of the internet, although it can appear so serene, useful and helpful. Therefore meaning that the internet is a very complicated and interesting place.  

Another challenge I faced whilst completing this mini project was the uploading process. This is because, the video I had taken and used from my camera roll was over 100MB, therefore I couldn't upload it onto GitHub as the maximum amount that would work was 25MB. After a few hours of changing the size of the video to make it smaller, the smallest I could make it was 33MB, which is still significantly higher than the maximum amount of MB I could upload. Therefore, I downloaded a free compresser called HandBrake, and I had to learn how to use each function. After a while of meddling about with the functions (which would make the quality really bad), I finally created an end result which reduced the size of the mp4 but kept the quality of it appropriate and reasonable. Thus, I went back onto VS code and deleted the original mp4 I used and replaced it with the compressed version, and I had to type in the correct video so that my code would work. And I am going to reupload everything onto GitHub then resubmit my project (I previously handed the projects in and emailed Tom the compressed version of the file, however I changed my mind and decided to take matters into my own hands because I was very dedicated to making my projects work). 

Overall, this was a trial and error process but I am very happy with the outcome as I have also learnt many things from this project, including what each function does and how to use simple code structures.
