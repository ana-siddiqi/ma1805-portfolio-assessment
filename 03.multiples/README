This project was by far one of my favourite ones, because it is truly interesting and captivating. It portrays rapid and multicoloured circles aligned on top of one another, which move side to side when the mouse hovers over the drawing. This was a very interesting project to create, because I used new functions that I hadn't before which was also a challenge.
