This project is a creative and immersive drawing, with a blue background and a shocked emoji. It is an illustration of me testing out the different functions. One thing that stuck out to me the most was the moving around each function to create the final project. A challenge I faced whilst doing this project was understanding the meaning of each function, however at the end I understood the simple code structures. My coding experience was quite unique as I have never coded before so it was very fascinating.
